<h1>Final Goodbye</h1>
 Programs evolve. Like most programs, UC37software has evolved too. UC37software is spread out over many repositories, such as UC37-hotword, and UC37-skills. I am happy to announce that these programs have been combined to create a new, improved, and better version of UC37software. It is called Jimbot. I have renamed it because, let's face it, UC37 is not easy to say and has no meaning. From this point on, UC37 will remain open, but edits will no longer be made. Jimbot will continue to grow, and it is strongly encouraged that you use it over this program. I have high hopes for this program, and hope you will like it.

Welcome to UC37 software!
UC37 is an artificial intelligence program/task manager that acts like a human. He can help out by doing
things like turn on smart plugs and play music. He also keeps track of your system statistics, and can end unwanted processes just with voice. He can also run commands just with your voice. Installing the app is just 2 MB, but all of the packages is about 800 MB. (The raspberry pi has many of these packages pre-installed.) You can also press the edit button to open websites, run commands, and talk just with your voice!
