# UC37software
Welcome to UC37 software!
UC37 is an artificial intellagence program that acts like a human. When you talk to
him you will find that it is much like talking to a real person. Here is how you get
started:

Step 1:
First navigate to the Welcome folder and run the program labeled "run_this_first.py"
Wait for everything to download and do not close down your python editor until it is
done. Once downloaded, answer the questions.

Step 2:
Go to the main UC37software folder and click the file that says UC37.py (NOT plain 
UC37) click the run button to meet UC37! 
Enjoy!
