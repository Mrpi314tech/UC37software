# UC37software
Welcome to UC37 software!
UC37 is an artificial intelligence program that acts like a human. When you talk to
him you will find that it is much like talking to a real person. Here is how you get
started:

### Parts you need:

raspberry pi

usb microphone

speaker for 3.5 mm jack (hdmi doesn't work well)

### Step 1:

Make a weather account at http://weatherapi.com  Trying to find a new, free weather api. This one costs money. If you know any, please tell  me!

Use the API key it gives you when the survey asks for your api key. If you don't buy an api key, just skip it.

### Step 2:

First run this command in the command prompt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mrpi314tech/UC37software && chmod +x ~/UC37software/UC37_install.sh && ~/UC37software/UC37_install.sh
```
### Step 3:

Go to the main menu and open the path called "Other" then click the application called UC37. UC37 will wake up!
